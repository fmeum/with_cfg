# How to Contribute

## Formatting

Starlark files should be formatted by buildifier.
We suggest using a pre-commit hook to automate this.
First [install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation),
then run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

Otherwise later tooling on CI will yell at you about formatting/linting violations.

## Updating BUILD files

Some targets are generated from sources.
Currently this is just the `bzl_library` targets.
Run `bazel run //:gazelle` to keep them up-to-date.

## Releasing

1. Determine the next release version, following semver
1. Tag the repo and push it (or create a tag in GH UI)
1. Watch the automation run on GitHub actions
